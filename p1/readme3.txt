The goal of Program 3 is to find the longest common subsequence of two gien sequences (fileX, fileY) using a recursive approach with memoization.

This program will output the following:
fileOutput:
uint - longest length
float - algorithm execution time

Operations:
$ make p3
$ ./program3 <fileX> <fileY> <fileOutput>
